# Watchtower - agent
This is the agent that handles all security related events as well as blocking of IP's that try to brute force into Windows machines. This is part of an Watchtower SIEM/IPS solution made by Tier 1 Security. It uses less than 25MB of ram and less than 1% of CPU during runtime. 

## Features
Pushes security events to the cloud.
Blocks IP addresses by adding them to the windows firewall.

## Installation
For the time being, please use either an IDE of your choosing and import the existing dotnet solution. Either that or you can download the run the executable directly.

## Usage
If you don't specify where to send the data, the script will still run. It just won't send any security related data. It will still block IP addresses that try to brute force into machines.
